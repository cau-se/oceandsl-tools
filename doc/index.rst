Overview - OceanDSL Tools and Analysis
======================================

The OceanDSL project aims to create DSLs to support the separation of concerns
in scientific models, including parameter management, configuration, and
parameter selection. Therefore, we need a good understanding of the code of
scientific models and therefore, tools to recover architecture and behavior
of these models.

Thus, we create a growing set of tools to perform architecture recovery or
discovery when there never was an architecture planned. Analyzes of the
architecture models and support for optimizing the architecture.
